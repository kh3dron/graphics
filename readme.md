# GRAPHICS

I've always loved the look of ultra simple, old school computer graphics (TRON is a favorite movie of mine - *the first one*). I'm learning graphics programming with WebGL as a relevant skill to better explore some other things I find really cool:

- Learn some frontend & javascript (I mostly do devops & cloud infra work professionally)
- General datavis stuff
- Math & CS oddities:
  - Flocking algorithms (boids)
  - cellular automata (Game of Life)
  - Procedural generation (trees)
- simply to code more, especially in some new languages

My first goal is creating a large environment, something like a virtual city or museum, that I can add more and more features to as I get better in all these areas. I like the idea of a single place that can keep getting more complex and alive. Maybe I'll even host it somewhere.

## What's in this repo

- The many programs I worked through in reading the textbook "WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Programming with WebGL"
  - All nicely viewable from the "multiviewer.html" page
- some Generator programs to create .obj / .mtl files from python files.
- objViewer.html, which is for exploring those custom made environments.

' BUGS / TODOs

- fix screen aspect ratio so window resizing doesn't change geometry
